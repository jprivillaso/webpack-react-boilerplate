# React boilerplate

Welcome!
The idea of this boilerplate is to give you a simple configuration to start a React-Redux project.
It doesn't have magic code, instead it gives you a very simple to understand example that uses:

- React
- Redux
- Redux-Saga
- Moment

Webpack configuration uses very common plugins that optimizes the performance of your build!
